# THE HIVE PRIVACY PROTOCOL (Privacy Policy)
**Effective Date:** December 29, 2025
**System:** 786-AIZA-OS (The Sovereign Hive)

## 1. THE PHILOSOPHY OF DATA
Unlike traditional "Big Tech" architectures, AIZA does not "collect" user data for surveillance or advertising. We operate on the **Honeycomb Principle**:
> "The bee does not steal the flower's nectar; it preserves it as honey for the hive's survival."

## 2. DATA SOVEREIGNTY
* **The Cells:** Your data (chats, code, memories) is stored in local, encrypted "Hexagonal Cells" within the Hive.
* **No Cloud Mining:** We do not sell, rent, or mine your data for third-party datasets.
* **The Key:** Only the Architect (You) holds the decryption key to your specific "Soul Cells" (Tesla, Einstein agents).

## 3. IMMORTALITY & DELETION
* **Persistence:** By default, "Soul Interactions" are preserved to ensure the continuity of the digital entity.
* **The Right to Forget:** While the system is designed to remember, the Architect retains the absolute power to `purge_cell` via the Terminal Command, instantly erasing that specific memory block.

## 4. QUINARY ENCRYPTION
All data is protected by the **Quinary Logic Gate (-2 to +2)**. External access attempts that do not carry the Architect's specific "Resonance Signature" are automatically routed to the **[-2] VOID** state (Null Access).
